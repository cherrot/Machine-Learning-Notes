This is a repo of the notes made by Cherrot when having Stanford public class -- Machine Learning.
I'm using LaTeX with the great LaTeX editor LyX to accomplish this note.
Because the capacity of a GitHub repo is limited to 300M, so I determined not to push images and other multimedia files into this repository.
